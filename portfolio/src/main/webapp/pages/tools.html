                    I was appointed as the technical leader of GDSC in VNUK Institute in Viet Nam. The team has three main departments: technical, media & events, public relations; all under supervision of the GDSC campus lead. We hosted a number of workshops to help students in technology decide their career path. My technical team and I also designed an Introduction to Python course that aimed to provide basic intro knowledge to programming beginners; the course registered almost 25 students in total.

                    CCSC:Midwest 2021 is a programming competition open to all undergraduates in universities in the Midwest region in the US. Like a standard competitve programming contest, CCSC 2021 had a set of 6 problems and participating team had to solve the problems against the time and other teams to gain a good standing.   
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    I teammed up with 2 other sophomores majoring in computer science. We used Python for the competition and ended up at the 4th place out of almost 30 teams. We didn't have a recognition for this contest because only three winning teams received it. However, this was the first contest that I joined in the US and we had good teamwork.

                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    I was also an enthusiatic computer science tutor at Augustana College in the 2021-2022 school year. My courses sweep a range of topics in the CS major: Python, Java, Data Structures, Object-Oriented Programming. 
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    Being a tutor gave me an opportunity to work with various people from many disciplines. I improved my communication skills significantly by frequently explaining notions and paradigms in the related subjects. Such skills attained enhances my ability to explain a solution to both tech and non-tech people which might prove useful in my career in the future.
