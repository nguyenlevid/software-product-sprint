                        <p>Coming back from the COVID-years, I still looked energetic and fresh as always. This was a selfie sent to my mom to make sure that I had a safe flight to the USA for my 2021-2022 school year.</p>

                        <p>This photo was to mark the first time I visited a big city in the US. Chicago didn't fail to show me it is a windy and beautiful city</p>

                        <p>This is a snap photo of Dr. Sward - my respected and hilarious Math professor. I was not intending to take a picture of him; I was photographing the lecture. Good smile anw.</p>

                        <p>There's a teenie-weenie river in my university named The Slough. This is the road I walk everyday to get to my classes. Best pictures can be taken here when fall starts. But I like it more when winter kicks in as it's more emotional.</p>
